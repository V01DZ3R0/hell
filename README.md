# hell
Linux only. Tiny HTTP Server on C, using only standard libraries. It is unfinished yet, going to add working interface and rewrite handler later, but now, it works. You can replace "site.html" aka homepage  with your .html in the same directory as code, that one is just an example. While running the code connect to http://localhost:666/home to see homepage.
